## Our team is looking to grow.

### Ready for a challenge?

Our team loves to tackle problems head on and we love working late nights to create amazing applications. We work with large amounts of code and important projects, so make sure you have the time to be able to `commit` (ha - get it).

### No experience? No problem.

We all start somewhere â€” we love to help mentor students who are passionate about learning and exploring what computer science can offer for their community.
